### Starter theme
Find out more here: www.jointswp.com 
Currently using Foundation 6.3.

### What tools do I need?
You can use whatever you want – seriously. While the Sass version comes with Bower and Gulp support out of the box, you aren’t required to use those by any means. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It’s completely up to you how you decide to build you theme.

### Getting Started With Gulp
- Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- Using the command line, navigate to your theme directory
- Run npm install
- Run gulp to confirm everything is working
